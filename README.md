# Overview
Hi there, thank you for viewing this repo!

In this project, I aim to backtest the alphas (101 in total) that were used in live trading by WorldQuant at 2016. Formulas for these alphas were published by Kakushadze ([available here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.00991.pdf)). The data for backtesting include stock prices, dividends and splits for 3000 US publicly-traded companies (up to 2018.04.01), available from [here](https://data.nasdaq.com/databases/WIKIP#documentation). The backtest engine used is [zipline-reloaded](https://github.com/stefan-jansen/zipline-reloaded) maintained by Stefan Jansen.

For brevity, technical problems that I encountered and addressed are not all shown in the code here. If you are doing similar things and encounter problems, feel free to reach out to me to discuss!
